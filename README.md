# 3d-Scene-ThreeJS
## Project Description: 
You are required to implement any good-looking graphics scene of your own choice. A 
proposed choice (which you don’t have to strictly follow but have to create something on 
the same scale) might be a scene containing: 
* Realistic sea water with moving waves and sun reflection.
* Skybox
* Shadows and Lights 
* Grassy Island next to the sea, preferably wavy due to wind.
* Some Loaded Models (boats, houses, etc.), both moving and static.
* Some Animated Models (people - animals – etc.).
* Moving clouds, rain, or fog.
* Thunder and lightning.
* Some moving fire on the island would be nice.
